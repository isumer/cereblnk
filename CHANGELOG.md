## [1.0.0] — First release

An adaptive multi-agent engineering platform for Claude Code: a
conducting conversation that reads intent, routes work to specialist
subagents, and refuses to hand back an answer that nothing checked.

### What ships

- **16 entry points.** `/cb-dispatch` reads a plain-language request and
  routes it; the rest are typed directly — deciding (`think`, `frame`,
  `requirements`, `design`), building (`do`, `implement`, `refactor`),
  checking (`pr-review`, `bug`, `qa`, `security-audit`, `docs`), and two
  session guards (`careful`, `boundary`).
- **26 specialist agents** across core, engineering, lifecycle and
  context roles, each with a stated decision domain and an advise-only
  boundary. An agent does not decide outside its expertise.
- **77 domain skills** — how an expert thinks in a stack — plus **176
  constraint files** carrying the enforceable form. Constraints attach
  by file glob and by the detected stack: a framework's rules load only
  when the project declares that framework.
- **12 hooks**, spent only where a mistake is expensive: delegation
  during an active run, secrets in a write, destructive shell commands,
  edits outside a declared boundary, oversized subagent returns, window
  occupancy, transcript archiving before compaction, and scratch files
  at the repository root.
- **17 policies** covering risk, budgets, gates, agent selection,
  consensus, grounding, and the run contract.
- **22 verify suites** — one deterministic pass over manifests, hooks,
  parsers, linters, the agent–skill graph, and the discovery cascade.

### How it works

Context is not shared; knowledge is. Subagents write their full
Response Blocks to disk and return a ten-line digest, so the conducting
conversation holds decisions rather than file contents. Budgets are
computed from the measured window, never assumed. Every claim carries an
epistemic label — known, derived, estimated, assumed, speculative — and
those labels survive summarisation all the way to the user.

Verification is structural rather than stylistic. A Verifier re-derives
the result from evidence without reading the original reasoning; a
Challenger must construct a concrete counter-scenario or state that none
exists; a Consistency pass compares fact sets across agents. How many of
the three run is decided by risk, not by preference.

### Honest boundaries

- `scripts/verify` green covers the **deterministic** layer: guards,
  parsers, linters, the skill graph. It does not verify workflow
  behaviour, which is prompt-driven and can only be established by
  running the workflows.
- Budget enforcement, ACP conformance, and gate blocking are
  Discipline-class: enforced by instructions and checking agents, not by
  the platform. `05_EXECUTION_REALITY_MAP.md` states which mechanisms
  are real and which are convention.
- Lifecycle workflows — release, deploy, incident, retrospective, ADR,
  changelog, health, memory management, session continuity — are
  planned, not shipped.
- Agent-to-agent messaging is deliberately absent. Agents exchange
  structured blocks through the conductor; there is no side channel, and
  that is a design commitment rather than a gap.
